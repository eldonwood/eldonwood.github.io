# Today I Learned

## Open Source by Default

By the end of 2016, almost every major front-end application at Artsy was [Open Source by Default](http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html). This means looking for reasons for something to be closed-source as opposed to reasons to be open. Our entire working process is done in the open, from developer PRs to QA. This post was also written collaboratively and in the open as you can see [here](https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/pull/325).

Sometimes it makes sense to keep some details private for competitive reasons. We therefore also create a private GitHub repository for front-end teams that require cross-project issues and team milestones. This is done using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com), and is managed by Engineering leads and Product Managers.
